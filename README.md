This  The direct link for the app is [here!](https://bitalert.netlify.com/)

## Landing Page

## Register Page
This is where a user can create a new account.  Since the software is used for a specific companies inventory a company code is required to create an account.  When all the information is entered and validated on the server side, the password is then salted and hashed with ``bcryptjs`` and all of the information is stored on the db.  The user is redirected to the login page where they can use their new credentials to login.

## Login Page
Here a user may login if they have already created an account.  The user is authenticated with ``passport.js`` and the password handled by ``bcryptjs``.  When a user is succesfully authenticated the authentication is stored in a session so the user can access protected routes.

## Reports Page
The reports page compares current inventory quantity to the reorder point set on each item.  All items with a quantity below the reorder point are then displayed in a ordered list.
